# AdLCF
AdLib &amp; XT-CF add-on for SHARP PC-4700 series XT compatible notebook.

Most of the circuit are from AdLib clone https://github.com/schlae/adlib and XT-CFv4 http://www.malinov.com/Home/sergeys-projects/xt-cf-lite. 

Just build a proper PCB and addressing using a PLD, nothing else

Use KiCAD 5.99+ to open the project files.

IMPORTANT: remember to put a 27C64 with 8kb XT-CF BootROM into the PC-47xx onboard HDBIOS socket.
